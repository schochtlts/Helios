Amateur/Hobbyist Operating System by schochtlts

Nothing much special; mostly for self education purposes. 

The final goal would be to have an OS running on luajit with a very minimal support (from kernel/core/). Luajit will be running in ring0 as will most programs. Ideally, you could easly write drivers and programs in lua and modifying them whle the OS is running (hence luajit).
