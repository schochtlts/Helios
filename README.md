Amateur/Hobbyist Operating System by schochtlts

Nothing much special; mostly for self education purposes. 

The final goal would be to have an OS running on luajit with a very minimal support outside of it. Luajit will be running in ring 0 as will most programs. Ideally, you could easly write drivers and programs in lua and modifying them while the OS is running (hence luajit).
